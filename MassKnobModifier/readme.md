This tool is a script that lets you mass edit a single knob of multiple nodes. It can either be by selection or by class.

There are 3 modes:

1. Affect a bunch of specific nodes by selecting them and triggering the tool/function (hotkey or script run).
2. Affect all nodes of one type/class by typing in the class name and pushing a button.
3. Affect all nodes of one class by selecting that node, and getting its class by selection, so you don't have to type the class name.


Works on almost all knobs including labels and disable.
Expressions also work, if you put an = sign before the expression.

The hotkey I have included in the menu.py file maps it to ctrl+m, but feel free to change that to whatever you prefer.
